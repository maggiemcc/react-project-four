## Fourth Course Project: Adding SignUp/Login form and Auth:

- Create a Signup form that captures at least 3 bits of user information.
    - The elements in the form must indicate if they are required or not.
    - The elements in the form must be validated.
    - The submission of the form must be stored in local state using the useContext hook.
- State must be handled using the useState and useContext hooks.
- Have component side effects that are handled using the useEffect hookcomponent(s).
- Use an authorization context to decide if a page should be shown or not based on a User being logged in or not.
- Have at least 4 distinct routes to which the user can navigate.
