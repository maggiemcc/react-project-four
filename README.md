## Third Course Project - Adding Context and a Netlify Function to retrieve API data:

- Create a React Context and provide a Context Provider functional component.
- Provide a means for components to use the Context you created.
- Write a Netlify function that will retrieve your API data and provide it to your React component(s).
- Your Context component has at least one side effect that is handled using the useEffect hook
